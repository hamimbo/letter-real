Dear Mimuuuu,

I can hardly put into words the love and respect I have for you, but I’ll try my best. I want to start by saying that you mean the world to me. These past 1 year and 11 months we’ve shared together have been full of memories, moments, and feelings that I will cherish forever. I know I have made countless mistakes, and the weight of those mistakes still sits heavily in my heart. But more than anything, I need you to know how much I love you, and how sorry I am for everything I’ve done that hurt you.

When I think back to the time we spent together before everything fell apart, I remember how happy we made each other. You loved me with everything you had, and for that, I am eternally grateful. You gave me everything, and I... I failed you. My own flaws and mistakes led us to that painful place where we had to let go. I know that I can never undo the damage that I caused, but I want to make things right. I want to show you that I can be the person you deserve. The person you believed in before my actions drove a wedge between us.

<hr>

I remember the anger I felt, the frustration I took out on you, and the cruel words I said. I let my emotions get the better of me, and I didn’t listen to you when you were trying to speak your truth. Instead of being the partner you needed, I became someone I never wanted to be. You didn’t deserve any of it, and the pain I caused you still haunts me every day. I failed to understand how much you were trying to say, how much you were trying to show me, and how much you loved me in those moments. And for that, I am so deeply sorry.

When we broke up in December, a part of me died inside. I didn’t know how to function without you, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the love we had. I cried for days, wondering how I could have been so blind, how I could have let something so beautiful slip away. I know that I can’t change the past, but I want to spend every moment of the future making up for it. I want you to know that no matter how hard it was, I never stopped loving you.

<hr>

Now, here we are again, together, and I am so incredibly grateful that you’ve given me another chance. But, Mimuuuu, I know things aren’t the same as before. I know that your love for me has changed, and I can feel the distance between us. It hurts to know that the love you once had for me is not the same now. But I am willing to do whatever it takes to earn that love back. I am ready to show you how deeply I care for you and how much I want to make things right.

<hr>

I will try my absolute best to love you the way you always wanted to be loved, with patience, understanding, and respect. I know that love isn’t just about saying the right things or doing the right things in the moment – it’s about consistency, care, and making you feel valued every single day. And that’s what I want to do for you, always. I know that I have a lot of work to do, but I am committed to being a better partner to you, the partner you deserve.

<hr>

But, Mimuuuu, I also need your help. I need you to believe in me, to show me the love you once did, because that’s the love I need to feel to be the best version of myself for you. I need you to guide me when I falter, and help me understand your needs, your feelings, and your heart. I want to love you the way you need me to, but I also need to feel the love you gave me before. I don’t want to make the same mistakes again. I don’t want to hurt you again.

<hr>

I don’t want to mess up anymore. I don’t want to cause you pain or frustration. I promise you that I will never again act the way I did before, and I will always try to be better for you, to listen when you speak, to understand when you feel. I will not raise my voice at you, I will not belittle you, and I will never ignore your feelings again. You deserve respect, care, and love, and that’s what I want to give you for the rest of my life.

<hr>

I want to build something stronger with you, Mimuuuu. I want to rebuild the trust that we lost and create new memories that are full of happiness and love. I know it won’t be easy, and I know it will take time, but I am willing to put in the effort. I believe in us, I believe in our love, and I believe in our future together. I know that we can get back to a place where we love each other deeply, without fear of hurting one another.

<hr>

Thank you for giving me another chance, even when I don’t deserve it. Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and your willingness to work through the pain we’ve both been through. I will spend the rest of my life making sure you know how much you mean to me.<br>I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu a lot. I really do love you, and I will always love you. 


With all my love,<br>
Your Humming Bird
